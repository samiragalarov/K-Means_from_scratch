K-Means is one of the most popular "clustering" algorithms. K-means stores $k$ centroids that it uses to define clusters. A point is considered to be in a particular cluster if it is closer to that cluster's centroid than any other centroid.

K-Means finds the best centroids by alternating between (1) assigning data points to clusters based on the current centroids (2) chosing centroids (points which are the center of a cluster) based on the current assignment of data points to clusters.
